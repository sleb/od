# Phased Implementation Plan for Overdrip App Package with Thin Vertical Slices

## Overview

This plan focuses on delivering thin vertical slices of functionality, allowing for rapid iteration and learning through a working prototype. Each phase will incorporate end-to-end functionality, enabling quick adjustments based on feedback.

## Phase 1: Initial Setup and Prototype Development

**Objectives:**

- Set up the development environment and create a basic prototype that integrates all components.

**Tasks:**

1. Install necessary software on Raspberry Pi (Bun, Firebase CLI).
2. Connect moisture sensors and pumps to the Raspberry Pi.
3. Implement basic functionality to read moisture levels and control pumps.
4. Test the prototype to ensure basic operations work as expected.

## Phase 2: User Interaction and Configuration

**Objectives:**

- Develop user interaction features and configuration management.

**Tasks:**

1. Create CLI commands for user interaction (e.g., configure watering schedules).
2. Implement Firebase integration for configuration management.
3. Test user interactions and gather feedback for improvements.

## Phase 3: Enhanced Functionality and Feedback Loop

**Objectives:**

- Enhance the prototype based on user feedback and add more features.

**Tasks:**

1. Analyze user feedback and identify areas for improvement.
2. Implement additional features (e.g., logging, notifications).
3. Conduct user testing sessions to validate new features.

## Phase 4: Final Refinements and Deployment

**Objectives:**

- Finalize the application for deployment and ensure all features are functioning correctly.

**Tasks:**

1. Perform integration testing of all components.
2. Fix any identified issues and optimize performance.
3. Deploy the application on the Raspberry Pi and conduct final checks.

## Phase 5: Post-Deployment Support and Iteration

**Objectives:**

- Provide support for users and iterate on feedback.

**Tasks:**

1. Monitor application performance and user feedback.
2. Implement updates and improvements based on user needs.
3. Maintain documentation and support resources.
